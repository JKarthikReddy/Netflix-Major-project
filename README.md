# ðŸŽ¬ Netflix Content Trends Analysis for Strategic Recommendations

## ðŸŒŸ Project Description

[cite_start]Netflix is a leading global streaming platform, but it faces intense competition from rivals like Amazon Prime and Disney+[cite: 8, 9].

[cite_start]This project, titled **'Content Trends Analysis for Strategic Recommendations'** [cite: 10][cite_start], addresses this need by analyzing a Netflix dataset of 7,789 records, covering Movies and TV Shows released between 2008 and 2021[cite: 3, 6].

[cite_start]The analysis focuses on uncovering how the distribution of content (Movies vs. TV Shows, genres, and country contributions) has evolved over time[cite: 11].
